The sustainability of human impacts by logging, farming and tourism are evaluated within faith perspective. Students learn natural history of this place to equip the future practice of natural history in other places. The importance of natural history is applied to a variety of student interests, including medicinal uses of plants, nutrient cycling, and impact of food on human and environmental health. Offered between the spring college semester and the end of the spring high school semester to provide an opportunity to investigate the natural history almost entirely in the field during this very active time of year.
